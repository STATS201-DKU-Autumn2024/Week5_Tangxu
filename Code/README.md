## Visualization

### SHAP Dependence Plot
The SHAP Dependence Plot provides insights into the relationship between `sensor_measurement_2` and its SHAP values. The plot highlights how the feature impacts the model's predictions, with `sensor_measurement_8` being used as a color-coded interaction variable. Key observations include:
- A strong negative correlation between `sensor_measurement_2` and its SHAP values, indicating that lower values of this feature lead to higher importance in predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
- Interaction with `sensor_measurement_8` reveals additional patterns, with higher values of `sensor_measurement_8` (red points) amplifying the effect of `sensor_measurement_2` on the model's predictions.

### Time-Series Trends
The time-series visualization showcases trends in `sensor_measurement_2` and `sensor_measurement_3` for a specific unit in the NASA dataset. Key observations include:
- Both sensor measurements exhibit increasing trends as the unit progresses through its operational cycles.
- High variability in the sensor measurements highlights the importance of capturing these patterns for accurate predictive maintenance.

## Dataset

This project utilizes two primary datasets to explore and model predictive maintenance:

1. **MetroPT Dataset**: This dataset provides detailed logs on maintenance activities, operational metrics, and failure events from Lisbonâ€™s metro system. It includes key variables that track the conditions and degradation of metro components over time, offering a robust foundation for predictive maintenance modeling in public transportation.

2. **NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data**: This dataset contains real-time sensor readings from simulated turbofan engines under different operational conditions. It captures degradation patterns across high-stress engine components, allowing for real-time analysis and prediction of component failure.

### Data Dictionary
A comprehensive data dictionary describing all relevant variables in each dataset can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/STATS201-DKU-Autumn2024/Week5_Tangxu/tree/main/Data) section of this repository. The data dictionary includes detailed descriptions, data types, and units for each variable, facilitating better understanding and usage of the datasets within the predictive maintenance context.
