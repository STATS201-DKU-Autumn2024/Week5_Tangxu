## Overview
The purpose of this code folder is to provide a comprehensive implementation of predictive maintenance analysis using machine learning techniques. It focuses on analyzing and modeling multimodal datasets, including the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Data and the MetroPT dataset. The tasks performed include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, normalizing, and preparing data for predictive modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing key data trends and visualizing sensor readings, failure patterns, and operational conditions.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and component failures.
4. **Model Interpretability**: Using SHAP analysis to understand feature importance and model decision-making.
5. **Visualization**: Generating insightful plots to support data-driven decision-making and maintenance strategies.

## Expected Outputs

### Visualizations
- **SHAP Analysis**:
  - **SHAP Dependence Plot**: Provides insights into the relationship between `sensor_measurement_2` and its SHAP values. The plot highlights how the feature impacts the model's predictions, with `sensor_measurement_8` used as a color-coded interaction variable.
    - Observations:
      - A strong negative correlation between `sensor_measurement_2` and its SHAP values indicates that lower values of this feature lead to higher importance in predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
      - Interaction with `sensor_measurement_8` reveals additional patterns, with higher values amplifying the effect of `sensor_measurement_2`.
